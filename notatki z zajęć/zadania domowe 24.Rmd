## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
library(janitor)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
pay_gap2 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tomasz-Olczyk/wizualizacjaR/main/case%20studies%20/pay_gap_uk.csv") 

```




```{r}
glimpse(pay_gap)
```


```{r}
view(pay_gap)
```

```{r}
z1 <- ggplot(pay_gap) +
  geom_segment(aes(y = occupation, 
                   x = women_average_annual_salary, 
                   xend = men_average_annual_salary, 
                   yend = occupation)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = occupation, x = men_average_annual_salary)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = occupation, x = women_average_annual_salary))

```

```{r}

ggplotly(z1)
