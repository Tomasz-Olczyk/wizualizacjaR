## R Markdown



```{r}
kraj <- c("CZE", "POL", "HUN", "SVK")
```


```{r}
wyszehrad <- panteon %>% 
  filter(countryCode3 %in% kraj) 
```



```{r}

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
